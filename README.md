## by Yaser Issa


## Dataset


The Programme for International Student Assessment ('PISA') is a global study conducted in member and non-member countries by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to evaluate educational systems by measuring 15-year-old school pupils' scholastic performance in mathematics, science, and reading. and this dataset is the outcome of the 2012 study



## Summary of Findings

> Mexico is a leader in student participation across the country.Science and math scores have been compared to determine if there is a similarity in their distributions. Through the use of statistical analysis, it has been found that the distribution of science scores appears to be similar to that of math scores. It would seem that more women than men participate. most students scored 9-10 on average. With their outstanding average scores, the United Kingdom and New Zealand have distinguished themselves from other nations. It seemed that most nations scored poorly on the socioeconomic index. The majority of students, it appears, spend 1-3 hours on their homework. The majority of students dislike math. The majority of parents think math is an important subject and that it will be important or necessary for your future career. Males are better off financially than females are. There is a significant positive correlation between socioeconomic status and wealth, indicating that as one rises, the other must as well. Since socioeconomic status and wealth have a strong correlation, neither variable will have a significant impact on academic performance. In most countries, there are more female than male participants. Boys seem to perform better than girls in math and science, but girls seem to perform better in reading. The wealth gap between men and women persists despite the advancements in gender equality. Inequality in access to resources and opportunities, for example, as well as other factors, are all to blame.

## Key Insights for Presentation

> In the presentation, I will be discussing the effect of wealth and socioeconomic status on grades. We will explore how these factors can influence a student's academic performance and how they can be addressed in order to ensure whether all students have an equal opportunity to succeed. After that, I'll do Wealth vs. Grade, with gender variations.
